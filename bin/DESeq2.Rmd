First, the data needs to be loaded (obviously).

```{r}
directory <- "../data/processed_raw_counts.txt"
data <- read.table(directory, sep='\t', header=TRUE, row.names=1)
```



Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
